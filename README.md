#   Real-Time Traffic Data Monitoring Pipeline (Databricks + PySpark)

## Project Overview 

The Real-Time Traffic Data Monitoring Pipeline is a scalable data engineering solution designed to ingest, process, and analyze streaming traffic data for real-time insights. This project leverages modern Lakehouse architecture using Databricks, PySpark, Delta Lake, and AWS services to build an end-to-end pipeline that handles high-volume traffic sensor data efficiently. Traffic data (vehicle count, speed, timestamps, etc.) is streamed through Amazon Kinesis, processed in near real-time, and stored across Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers in Delta Lake for structured analytics and reporting.

The pipeline ensures:
- Reliable ingestion of streaming data
- Data cleansing and validation
- Real-time computation of traffic metrics
- Scalable storage and optimized querying
---
## Project Objective
- Build a scalable real-time traffic monitoring pipeline to handle continuous data from sensors  
- Process high-volume streaming data using AWS Kinesis for near real-time ingestion  
- Store and transform data in Databricks Delta Lake using Medallion Architecture
- Ensure high data quality by filtering invalid and corrupt records
- Generate analytics for congestion detection, traffic patterns, and anomaly identification  
- Provide interactive dashboards to support real-time monitoring and decision-making
- Enable testing and validation using Pytest for data accuracy
- Set up alerting mechanisms (e.g., Slack notifications) for abnormal traffic conditions

##   Dataset

### Dataset Source  
Simulated Traffic Sensor Data (Streaming via Amazon Kinesis)

The dataset represents real-time traffic data collected from sensors across city roads.

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sonalsadia/traffic-detection-dataset

---

### Datasets Used

- Traffic Readings → Vehicle count, speed, congestion  
- Vehicle Metrics → Flow rate, density, delay  
- Speed Monitoring → Speed violations and variance  
- Incident Events → Accidents and disruptions  
- Signal Performance → Traffic signal efficiency  

These datasets simulate a **real-world smart city traffic system**.

### Purpose

Generate **business-ready datasets for analytics and forecasting**.

### Features Generated

- Average Speed (avg_speed): Calculates mean vehicle speed for each sensor and time window

- Vehicle Count (vehicle_count): Total number of vehicles detected per event or interval

- Congestion Flag (congestion_flag): Binary indicator (0/1) showing whether traffic is congested based on speed thresholds

- Congestion Level (congestion_level): Categorizes traffic into Low / Medium / High based on speed and volume

- Rolling Average Speed (10min_avg_speed): Computes moving average speed over a 10-minute window for trend analysis

- Traffic Density: Derived from vehicle count and road capacity to measure load on roads

- Signal Efficiency Metrics": Measures performance of traffic signals (e.g., wait time, flow efficiency)

- Time-Based Aggregations: Metrics analyzed by hour, day, and date for trend analysis
- Anomaly Detection Flags: Identifies unusual traffic patterns or sudden drops/spikes
